SALT Lending


Donatella wants to educate her kids about investing in cryptocurrencies. To accomplish this, she will create a virtual crypto exchange where they can pretend to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. You are Donatella.

Write a web app (preferably in React and Node, but not required) that tracks the price of Bitcoin (in USD), as well as the prices of Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Monero (in BTC). Each kid should start with 10,000 USD and 0 balance for each crypto asset. The app should allow the kids to view the current prices of assets, place orders, view their portfolio distribution, and view the total value. To keep things simple, ALL TRADES MUST INVOLVE BTC. The kids must use USD to buy BTC, then they can use BTC to buy and sell alts. Obviously, we need to know which kid is making the trade, but don't prioritize authentication. Use a DB of your choice.
